1. How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented? 
	- There are 3 endpoints in that application in the PlayerResources.java file where the CRUD methods are implemented
2. PlayerResource.java 
	a. What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
		- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
	b. Compare and contrast the following: 
		i. SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
			- JDBC statement objects are like wrappers to SQL Query Statements which take in their arguments and then format them into 
				SQL queries.
	 	ii. SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
			- JDBC result sets are formatted like the results of a SQL query, and are a subset of the SQL relation since only certain rows are
				selected with the JDBC result set. Each element in the List<Player> is a row as a result JDBC result set.
	c. Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
		- You use it to see if a player has a name or not. If there is no name, then the name field is NULL.
3. Player.java 
	a. What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
		- You use it to implement and alter a player object in the Database
	b. How does it compare with the Player table?
		- You are wrapping up the class with the Player table, with the class having all the variable fields that are in the table. This class is
			used to alter the Player table, read from it, and insert into it.
